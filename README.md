This project is the result of miscellaneous work produced while analyzing the Lake Macatawa watershed.
Much of what is done here in exploring the Erie dataset was used as a basis for our own watershed data set scripts.

The Erie data set is composed of three files:
- The metadata file includes information about water samples, such as when and where the samples were collected and various corrosponding physical measurements.
- The shared file includes information about how many times different groups of bacteria are identified within the samples collected.
- The taxonomy file connects taxonomic information to each bacterial group labeled in the shared file.

The Lake Erie data are described in full by Berry et al. (2016), and their repository can be found here: https://github.com/DenefLab/chab-microbial-ecology
In short, the purpose of that study was to understand how bacteria communities change during cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs).
